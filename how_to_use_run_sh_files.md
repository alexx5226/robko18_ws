Give execute permission to your script:
chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh

Open a terminal and source:
source ~/robko18_ws/devel/setup.bash

And to run your script in the terminal type:

/path/to/yourscript.sh

or
Since . refers to the current directory: if yourscript.sh is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:

./yourscript.sh

EXAMPLE 
./run_mover4_simulated_moveit.sh <press enter>
