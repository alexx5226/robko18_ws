urdf/mybot.gazebo
urdf/materials.xacro
urdf/macros.xacro

These three correspond respectively to:

• all the gazebo-specific aspects of our robot
• definition of the materials used (mostly colors)
• definitions of some macros for easier description of the robot
Every file has to contain the robot tag and everything we put in them should be in this tag.
The first tag will first call the xacro script to convert of xacro description into an actual URDF.
This URDF is then inserted into a ROS parameter called “robot_description” (this is a standard name 
used by many ROS tools).
